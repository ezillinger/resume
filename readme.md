# My Resume in HTML5 with Bootstrap

Designed to be minimalist, mobile friendly, and printable

Requires nothing but Bootstrap 3 (included)

Boostrap 3 was EOL'd in 2019 but upgrading to the latest version is non-trivial and it still seems to work. When I started this over 10 years ago this was the latest and greatest. Don't judge my HTML/CSS too much, I'm not trying to be a front-end developer.
